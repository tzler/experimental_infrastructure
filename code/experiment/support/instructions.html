<p style='font-size:200%; text-align: center'> <strong>Welcome to our experiment!</strong></p>

<p style='font-size:125%; text-align: center'>
<strong> We're studying how people solve unfamiliar problems without verbal instructions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In this game, your goal is to learn which actions lead to earning a higher bonus. We can't tell you exactly which actions, but here is a hint: If you're on a computer, those actions will be mouse clicks on the screen. If you're on a tablet or smartphone, those actions will be taps on the screen. You will know by looking near the bottom of the screen how much bonus you have earned so far. When one of your actions has earned you a bonus, this number will go up. If you can't see the bonus meter after you move past the first image, make sure you scroll down in the <strong>MTURK</strong> window.

<strong>
  The more effort you put into this experiment the larger your bonus will be!
</strong>
</p>

<p>
The experiment will end either when a) 30 minutes of the experiment has gone by, or b) you've learned everything in the task. If you are highly accurate, you will get a large bonus and get to end the experiment early! We'll give you several breaks throughout the experiment, where we'll pause the experiment timer for a moment. At any point during the break you can press a button to resume the experiment. If you don't return from the break in the time you've been given, the experimental timer will resume anyway, which will reduce the amount of bonus you can earn.

We want to make sure that this HIT looks the same to everyone, so we're asking that you use the default screen zoom setting on your device (zoom = 100%) on a <strong>Chrome</strong> browser. You won't be able to begin the experiment on any other browser. If you change these settings at any point in this experiment, the screen will go blank and remind you to change your screen settings back to the default. Take a moment, now, to make sure that your screen settings are at zoom = 100% before moving on to the next screen.
