# A 'Hello World!' example in node `:)`

Initialize this project with npm and accept defaults:

```  
npm init --yes
```

Install the module we'll need: 

```
npm install express
```

This will create a folder `node_modules` in this directory as well as a `package-lock.json` file. Check them out when you have time. 

Run the file we've given a standard node name: 

```
node app.js
```

You should see the following line printed on the console: `Example app listening on port 8888`

Enter the following in your browser:

```
http://<your_domain_name>:<port_number>
```

where `<your_domain_name>` is the full domain name you purchased (with the extension, e.g. cutename.com) and `<port_number>` is `8888`. You should see `Hello World!` printed out in your browser `:D`
