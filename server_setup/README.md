## Instructions

The instructions in this folder should be completing in the following order: 

1. **`server_setup.md`**: setting up a Digital Ocean [Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/), installing `node.js` and `mongodb`
2. **`domain_setup.md`**: setting up a domain name and routing it to your server using `Apache`
3. **`security_setup.md`**: enabeling standard security protocols (firewalls, SSL certificates for https)

#### Expected startup cost 

Going through the sequence above requires less than **`2 working hours`**--that is, if you're not trying to understand anything, but entering in the code we've provided. Given wait times for domain registration and processing, however, this can take up to three days--but not more. The steps above require purchasing a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/linux-distribution/ubuntu/), which requires a monthly fee (starting at `$5.00 a month`), as well as a domain name (variable cost, starting at `$0`). All of the other tools and scripts should be open-source and feely available.
