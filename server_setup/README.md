# Instructions

The instructions in this folder should be completing in the following order: 

1. **`server_setup.md`**: setting up a Digital Ocean [Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/), installing `node.js` and `mongodb`
2. **`domain_setup.md`**: setting up a domain name and routing it to your server
3. **`security_setup.md`**: enabeling standard security protocols (firewalls, SSL certificates for https)

#### Expected startup cost 

We expect this process to take less than **`3 working hours`**, but up to three days given wait times for domain registration and processing. The steps above require purchasing a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/linux-distribution/ubuntu/), which requires a monthly fee (starting at `$5.00 a month`), as well as a domain name (variable cost, starting at `$0`). All of the other tools and scripts should be open-source and feely available.
