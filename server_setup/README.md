# Instructions

The instructions in this folder should be completing in the following order: 

1. **`server_setup.md`**: setting up a Digital Ocean [Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/), installing `node.js` and `mongodb`
2. **`domain_setup.md`**: setting up a domain name and routing it to your server
3. **`security_setup.md`**: enabeling standard security protocols (firewalls, SSL certificates for https)

#### Expected startup cost (in time & money)

We expect this process to take less than **`3 working hours`**, but up to three days given wait times for domain registration and processing.

The steps above require purchasing a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/linux-distribution/ubuntu/), which requires a monthly fee (starting at **`$5.00 a month`**). If you are a member of an academic institution, it may also be possible to use server resources available to students, but these often come with lots of permission issues, and much less documentation. All of the other tools and scripts should be open-source and feely available.
