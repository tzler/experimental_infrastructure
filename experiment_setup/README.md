# `Experimental code`

The folders in this directory contain examples that utilize the server side infrastructure built out in `instructions`:

- `hello_world/` contains the simplest possible implementation of the tools we've developed: reading and writing to a mongo database, using a client side interface. 
- `experiment/` contains an example experiment that demonstrates how the tools we've developed can be adapted for any experiments you are already running online.
